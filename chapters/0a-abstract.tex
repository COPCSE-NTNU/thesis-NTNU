The shipping industry is a vast and complex trading system that is generally believed to be responsible for around 90\% of all world trade \parencite{GROTE2016511}. Since there is such an extreme amount of revenue generated by the industry, in order to get an edge financially, the various interested parties rely on accurate information regarding the supply and demand of the market. An increasing number of software solutions that helps in this regard is becoming more available. Furthermore, Automated identification system (AIS) transmitters transmit almost all commercial vessels’ navigational data making it a prime source for analysis of ship traffic and trading patterns. Recent research into AIS data shows that it can be used to predict vessels’ future destinations based on historical traffic and patterns. This report is part of preparation work for a Master’s thesis exploring these issues. The thesis aims to investigate methods already applied to predict future vessel destinations, and in collaboration with the maritime tech startup company Maritime Optima AS (MO), improve them using MO’s extensive data depth and then use the improved prediction method to forecast vessel supply on a global scale using MO’s extensive vessel and port database.
