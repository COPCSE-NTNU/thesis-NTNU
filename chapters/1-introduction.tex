\chapter{Introduction}

Over the years, several thesis templates for \LaTeX{} have been developed by different groups at NTNU. Typically, there have been local templates for given study programmes, or different templates for the different study levels – bachelor, master, and \acrshort{phd}.\footnote{see, e.g., \url{https://github.com/COPCSE-NTNU/bachelor-thesis-NTNU} and \url{https://github.com/COPCSE-NTNU/master-theses-NTNU}}

Based on this experience, the \acrfull{CoPCSE}\footnote{\url{https://www.ntnu.no/wiki/display/copcse/Community+of+Practice+in+Computer+Science+Education+Home}} is hereby offering a template that should in principle be applicable for theses at all study levels. It is closely based on the standard \LaTeX{} \texttt{report} document class as well as previous thesis templates. Since the central regulations for thesis design have been relaxed – at least for some of the historical university colleges now part of NTNU – the template has been simplified and put closer to the default \LaTeX{} look and feel.

The purpose of the present document is threefold. It should serve (i) as a description of the document class, (ii) as an example of how to use it, and (iii) as a thesis template.
