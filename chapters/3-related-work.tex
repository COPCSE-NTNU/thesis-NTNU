\chapter{Related work}
\label{chap:related_work}

The topic of \acrfull{ais} -based predictions has already been explored quite extensively, especially in recent years as \acrshort{ais} systems has become an enforced standard for commercial vessels in the industry. However, the \acrshort{ais} standard has mainly been applied for the purpose of maritime safety and navigation, and the existing academic work on this topic reflects this. Most of the related work consists of vessel trajectory predictions for the purpose of foreseeing possible future collisions or for detecting anomalies from established shipping lanes. These types of predictions are applicable for predicting a vessel's future position in a short time interval, in a limited geographical area, but with high positional accuracy. In order to establish the current state of the art of the topic area and establish to what extent the literature answers the proposed research questions, a literature review was conducted which is described in following section.

\section{Literature review}
\label{sec:lit_review}

As already mentioned, based on initial research into the thesis' topic area, there seemed to be an apparent trend in motivations of related work directed at short-term predictions for safety or navigational purposes. In contrast, this thesis aims at using \acrshort{ais}, and other attributes, for longer term predictions, or more precisely, port destination predictions. However, because of the exploratory nature of thesis, the literature review conducted was broad in order to include work that might have taken a different approach to solve the same problem. In order to organize the resulting papers, a categorical separation of papers based on motivation was defined as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
    \item The paper's motivation deems it completely irrelevant to the topic area.
    \item The paper's motivation includes vessel predictions, but on a smaller time or geographical scale making it irrelevant for comparison.
    \item The paper's motivation includes destination predictions making it relevant for further analysis.
\end{enumerate}

\textit{Category 0} is defined to filter out papers that were irrelevant but could not be excluded by narrowing the search query. \textit{Category 1} includes paper that relates to the established trend mentioned earlier where the proposed method seems relevant on a small scale, but is ultimately not applicable to the thesis' problem area. It also includes papers that considers relevant topics but not relevant solutions. Finally, the papers labeled with relevancy \texttt{2} falls within \textit{Category 2} and includes papers that falls within the same topic area and are relevant in terms of insight into the proposed research questions. In order to determine what papers fitted \textit{category 1} and \textit{2}, papers with a relevance higher than zero were further analyzed in order to determine the following attributes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Motivation} - what was the problem the paper aimed to solve.
    \item \textbf{Objective} - what was the proposed prediction method's objective (e.g. classification, prediction, clustering).
    \item \textbf{Data source} - what data source was used in the proposed solution.
    \item \textbf{Prediction method} - what prediction method was applied to solve the problem.
    \item \textbf{Geographical extent} - to what geographical extent was the solution applicable.
    \item \textbf{Time interval} - what were the limitations on prediction methods in terms of time or trajectory duration.
    \item \textbf{Validation method} - what methods were applied to validate the resulting prediction method.
    \item \textbf{Validation metrics} - what metrics were used when establishing validity of the solution.
\end{itemize}

In this literature review, the following search engines/libraries where used to collect relevant research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Scopus}\footnote{\url{https://www.scopus.com/}}
    \item \textit{Oria}\footnote{\url{http://ntnu.oria.no/}}
    \item \textit{ACM Digital Library}\footnote{\url{https://dl.acm.org/}}
\end{itemize}

These were chosen based on running test queries and evaluating the relevancy and range of the resulting papers. Furthermore, the proposed query had too many boolean operators for search engines like \textit{ScienceDirect}\footnote{\url{https://sciencedirect.com}}.

\subsection{Search query and filters}

The objective of the literature review was to conduct a broad search detecting papers related to multiple relevant topics such as \textit{vessel destination prediction}, \textit{vessel trajectory prediction}, \textit{vessel availability forecasting}, and \textit{maritime logistics}. Therefore, the search query used in the literature review was designed to find papers within multiple topics and was derived at from testing multiple queries on multiple search engines. For instance, the following queries were tested using the search engine provided by \textit{ScienceDirect}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``vessel trajectory'' OR ``ship trajectory'' resulted in \textbf{421} papers
    \item ais AND (``vessel trajectory'' OR ``ship trajectory'') resulted in \textbf{150} papers
    \item ais AND (prediction OR predicting) AND (``vessel trajectory'' OR ``ship trajectory'') resulted in \textbf{108} papers
\end{itemize}

The above queries returned a large number of papers relevant to \textit{category 1}, so in order to find more relevant papers, more specific queries were also tested:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``vessel destination'' OR ``ship destination'' OR ``vessel availability'' resulted in \textbf{389} papers
    \item ais AND (``vessel destination'' OR ``vessel availability'') resulted in \textbf{25} papers.
    \item ais AND (predicting OR forecasting) AND (``vessel destination'' OR ``vessel availability'' OR ``ship supply'') resulted in \textbf{18} papers.
\end{itemize}

Lastly, in order to find detect research approaching the same problem from a different direction such as not using \acrshort{ais} data, the following queries were also tested using \textit{Scopus} because of boolean operator limits on \textit{ScienceDirect}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item (vessel OR ship OR maritime) AND (destination OR availability OR supply) AND (prediction OR predicting OR forecasting OR logistics) resulted in \textbf{894} on \textit{Scopus}
    \item (vessel OR ship OR ``maritime logistics'') AND (destination OR availability OR supply) AND (prediction OR forecasting) resulted in \textbf{314} on \textit{Scopus}
    \item (vessel OR ship OR ``maritime logistics'') AND (destination OR availability) AND (predicting OR forecasting) resulted in \textbf{92} on \textit{Scopus}
\end{itemize}

The search terms that seemed to return the most relevant papers was combined into the final query used in the literature review shown in \cref{lst:search_query}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
    caption={Search query used in literature review},
    label=lst:search_query
]
ais AND (
    predict OR predicting OR forecast OR forecasting
) AND (
    vessel OR ship OR maritime
) AND (
    destination OR availability OR supply OR trajectory OR logistics
)
\end{lstlisting}

Moreover, the following filters was used to limit the search result:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The paper must be published in the last 5 years.
    \item The paper must be available in English.
    \item The paper must be available using the access rights provided by \acrshort{ntnu}.
\end{itemize}

As already mentioned, the search query was ran on the search engine \textit{Scopus}, thus the search query and filters was modified to the search engine's format as shown in \cref{lst:search_query_scopus}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
    caption={Search query used in Scopus including filters},

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Results}

Using the aforementioned search libraries, the defined search query returned a total of \textbf{109} papers. After removing the overlapping results from the different search engines there were a total of \textbf{89} unique papers that formed the foundation of the literature review.

\todo{update numbers}
First, the papers were evaluated based on the level of relevance as defined in \cref{sec:lit_review}. Out of the \textbf{89} papers, \textbf{49} fell within \textit{category 0}, \textbf{32} within \textit{category 1}, and \textbf{6} within \textit{category 2}.

The large number of irrelevant papers resulted from the broadness of the query that was designed to find results in multiple topic areas. Furthermore, there were some papers that was medical in nature but not labeled correctly in \textit{Scopus} and was returned as the term \acrshort{ais} is also an acronym of \textit{Arterial Ischemic Stroke}. Some papers were also not publicly available but was not excluded by the search, while other papers were deemed irrelevant as they concerned topics such as mapping fishing areas in a specific region, power and performance predictions using \acrshort{ais} data, or high level discussions of potential applications of \acrshort{ais} data analysis.

The large number of papers within \textit{category 1} further confirms the general trend of \acrshort{ais} -based predictions as the primary goal of most of the resulting papers were to predict future positions of vessels within a shorter time intervals for the purpose of either safety and navigation or anomaly detection. None of the papers within \textit{category 1} seemed applicable to predict vessel destination ports at a global scale, however, for reproducibility, all papers with a relevancy of \textit{1} are listed in \todo{APPENDIX}.

\end{table}

The remaining \textbf{}5 papers (listed in \cref{tab:most_relevant_papers}) were deemed relevant enough for further analysis in regards to the proposed research questions listed in \cref{sec:research_questions}. In addition, \cite{lechtenberg2019}, which was discovered during the process of testing queries, was also included in the analysis as it seemed highly relevant toward availability forecasting, but did not appear when using the two search engines in the final review.


\todo{copied from RPP}
\paragraphheader{RQ 1a: What prediction methods can be used to predict vessel destinations?}

Firstly, there was a large number of prediction methods that fell within \textit{category 1} that were not directly applicable for destination predictions on a global scale, but was applied to smaller scale positional predictions. These papers usually proposed some manner of clustering algorithm like \acrshort{dbscan} to classify trajectories and patterns with some form of point to point search along trajectories using either a form of \acrfull{rnn}, \acrfull{svm}, or \acrfull{knn} search.

A more relevant approach was proposed in \cite{Zhang2020AISApproach} that used a \acrfull{rf} -based similarity measurement combined with frequencies of port visits to predict traveling vessels' next destination port. In the paper, the proposed approach was compared with several other \acrshort{ml} and non-\acrshort{ml} methods of predicting destination ports in a similar fashion based on trajectory similarity. Using the proposed \acrshort{rf}-based approach, they achieved a "port accuracy" of \textit{66.57\%}, and a "city accuracy" of \textit{81.65\%}.

\cite{lechtenberg2019} used an ensemble approach to forecast vessel supply for the dry bulk cargo industry in predefined regions. This implicitly involved predicting port destinations in the form of voyage patterns and extrapolating port availability into regional availability. They mainly used the Markov Decision Process to predict next destination ports together with XGBoost to predict \acrshort{eta} and anchor time before leaving the current region. The paper claims a \textit{98\%} accuracy for regional availability, however, the accuracy for port prediction were not disclosed as well as the size and extent of the predefined regions that presumably would have a massive impact of accuracy as the larger the regions are, the easier it is to predict the next region. This is especially true for smaller vessels which may rarely or never leave a large enough region.

\todo{add the rest of papers from cat 2}

\paragraphheader{RQ 1b: What information can be used to predict vessel destinations?}

From the research within \textit{category 1}, historical \acrshort{ais} data was almost exlusively the only source for predictions. Furthermore, for the most part, only purely spatial attributes of the \gls{aivdm} protocol were used. However, when compared to \textit{category 2}, papers in \textit{category 1} where more frequently using navigational information such as \acrshort{cog}, \acrshort{sog}, and headings as these features proved crucial to detect collision situations and anomalies in voyage patterns.

All papers listed in \textit{category 2} relied on historical \acrshort{ais} data and only considered the geographical coordinates clustered as trajectories for destination predictions. They all also relied on a varied collection of port data as this is necessary to predict destination ports. Since \cite{Rosca2018GrandRoutes} and \cite{Bachar2018GrandDestination} were both published in response to \textit{``The DEBS Grand Challenge 2018''} they relied on the same input data that included \acrshort{ais} and port data from a single region covering the Mediterranean sea. On the other hand, \cite{Zhang2020AISApproach} had access to 141 million global historical \acrshort{ais} records from 2011 to 2017 and a global port database consisting of over 10 000 ports.

\paragraphheader{RQ 1c: How extensive are existing prediction methods?}

As mentioned frequently in this section, all papers from \textit{category 1} were, in some manner, limited by either geographical extent or time intervals as global destination prediction was not the focus of these papers. There were slight variances in these limitations ranging from time limitations of minutes to hours with some papers considering predictions up to one day. However, since a voyage can last longer than one month in many cases, positional predictions accurate up to one day in the future does not seem applicable to this thesis' problem area.

The papers within \textit{category 1}, were less limited by time and geographical extent. For instance, \cite{Zhang2020AISApproach} and \cite{lechtenberg2019} both were completely unrestricted by geographical extent or time frames, however, the first did require a current traveling trajectory to predict the next destination port but was capable of making predictions for any voyage no matter the length or duration.

However, all of the remaining papers listed in \cref{tab:most_relevant_papers} were only applied or tested regionally. \cite{Rosca2018GrandRoutes} and \cite{Bachar2018GrandDestination} proposed solutions to the same challenge using the same dataset containing data within the Mediterranean sea, however, it seems as both approaches are unrestricted in terms of time limitations. \cite{Karatas2020TrajectoryData} also proposed an apparent general destination prediction method, however, they were also limited by a dataset only covering the Mediterranean sea and only containing records spanning a couple of months. Additionally, \cite{Dobrkovic2018MaritimeData}'s proposed solution to long term predictions was also only validated on limited regions which were two Dutch provinces.

In conclusion, even papers that set out for long term destination predictions are mostly all focused on a particular area or region, and although the proposed solutions seem promising, they do not fill the global requirements of this thesis' goals. From the related work, it is apparent that only the solutions proposed in \cite{lechtenberg2019} and \cite{Zhang2020AISApproach} are globally extensive.

\paragraphheader{RQ 1d: How can the validity of the prediction methods be ensured?}

\todo{still copied from RPP from here on out}

\cite{lechtenberg2019} does not go very in-depth on this topic, however, the paper mentions dividing the data into \textit{90\%} training data and \textit{10\%} test data. The accuracy metric is taken from how much of the test data was accurate. \cite{Zhang2020AISApproach} did an extensive evaluation of their method including the five-folder cross-validation method to ensure the model is not over-fitted. This process includes dividing the data into five “folders” and using one folder at a time for evaluation and the others for training. If the general accuracy does not vary much across the evaluation folders, the model is not overfitted.


It seems that accuracy is the main measurement used to establish quality. Furthermore, \cite{lechtenberg2019} mentions using both the “mean absolute error” (MAE) and the “root mean square error” (RMSE) as quality indicators. \cite{Zhang2020AISApproach} mainly uses “average prediction distance error” (APDE) as their quality indicator which is based on the distance between the predicted trajectory and the actual trajectory.

\paragraphheader{RQ 1: How can \acrshort{ais} data combined with specific vessel details be applied to predict future destinations of maritime vessels?}

None of the papers found within the research areas considers any type of segmentation of vessels. It is, therefore, impossible to answer this research question based on the current state of the art of the problem area.
