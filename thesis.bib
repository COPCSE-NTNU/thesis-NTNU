    abstract = {Approximately 9.5billiontonnes of goods is transported over the world oceans annually with dry bulk representing the largest cargo group. This paper aims to analyse whether the transport and associated inputs of dry bulks into the sea create a risk for the marine environment. For this purpose, we analyse the international regulatory background concerning environmental protection (MARPOL), estimate quantities and identify inputs of such cargoes into the oceans (accidental and operational), and use available information for hazard assessment. Annually, more than 2.15milliontonnes of dry bulk cargoes are likely to enter the oceans, of which 100,000tonnes are potentially harmful to the marine environment according to the definition included in draft maritime regulation. The assessment of the threat to the marine environment is hampered by a lack of available information on chemical composition, bioavailability and toxicity. Perspectives for amendments of the unsatisfying pollution prevention regulations are discussed.}

    ABSTRACT = {Understanding maritime traffic patterns is key to Maritime Situational Awareness applications, in particular, to classify and predict activities. Facilitated by the recent build-up of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers, ship movement information is becoming increasingly available, both in coastal areas and open waters. The resulting amount of information is increasingly overwhelming to human operators, requiring the aid of automatic processing to synthesize the behaviors of interest in a clear and effective way. Although AIS data are only legally required for larger vessels, their use is growing, and they can be effectively used to infer different levels of contextual information, from the characterization of ports and off-shore platforms to spatial and temporal distributions of routes. An unsupervised and incremental learning approach to the extraction of maritime movement patterns is presented here to convert from raw data to information supporting decisions. This is a basis for automatically detecting anomalies and projecting current trajectories and patterns into the future. The proposed methodology, called TREAD (Traffic Route Extraction and Anomaly Detection) was developed for different levels of intermittency (i.e., sensor coverage and performance), persistence (i.e., time lag between subsequent observations) and data sources (i.e., ground-based and space-based receivers).},

abstract = {The need for a variety of auxiliary analytical tools to enhance marine safety and marine status awareness has been expressed by various platforms. The information that has been published while cruising is a rich resource for movement analysis of ships. Automatic Identification System (AIS), which is widely used in vessels, broadcasts information including the type of ship, identity number, state, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), location, speed, direction, and cargo. In this paper, to aid maritime operators, we work on arrival port, arrival time, and next position prediction on AIS messages, and propose three different approaches for the prediction of marine vessel movement. The experiments conducted against conventional supervised learning approaches reveal the improvement of the proposed solutions.},

abstract = {The DEBS Grand Challenge 2018 is set in the context of maritime route prediction. Vessel routes are modeled as streams of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data points selected from real-world tracking data. The challenge requires to correctly estimate the destination ports and arrival times of vessel trips, as early as possible. Our proposed solution partitions the training vessel routes by reported destination port and uses a nearest neighbor search to find the training routes that are closer to the query AIS point. Particular improvements have been included as well, such as a way to avoid changing the predicted ports frequently within one query route and automating the parameters tuning by the use of a genetic algorithm. This leads to significant improvements on the final score.},

abstract = {The ACM DEBS 2018 Grand Challenge focuses on (soft) real-time prediction of both the destination port and the time of arrival of vessels, monitored through the Automated Identification System (AIS). Venilia prediction mechanism is based on a variety of machine learning techniques, including Markov predictive models. To improve the accuracy of a model, trained off-line on historical data, Venilia supports also on-line continuous training using an incoming event stream. The software architecture enables a low latency, highly parallelized, and load balanced prediction pipeline. Aiming at a portable and reusable solution, Venilia is implemented on top of the Akka Actor framework. Finally, Venilia is also equipped with a visualization tool for data exploration.},

 abstract = {Spherical trigonometry was at the heart of astronomy and ocean-going navigation for two millennia. The discipline was a mainstay of mathematics education for centuries, and it was a standard subject in high schools until the 1950s. Today, however, it is rarely taught.Heavenly Mathematicstraces the rich history of this forgotten art, revealing how the cultures of classical Greece, medieval Islam, and the modern West used spherical trigonometry to chart the heavens and the Earth. Glen Van Brummelen explores this exquisite branch of mathematics and its role in ancient astronomy, geography, and cartography; Islamic religious rituals; celestial navigation; polyhedra; stereographic projection; and more. He conveys the sheer beauty of spherical trigonometry, providing readers with a new appreciation for its elegant proofs and often surprising conclusions.Heavenly Mathematicsis illustrated throughout with stunning historical images and informative drawings and diagrams that have been used to teach the subject in the past. This unique compendium also features easy-to-use appendixes as well as exercises at the end of each chapter that originally appeared in textbooks from the eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries.},
