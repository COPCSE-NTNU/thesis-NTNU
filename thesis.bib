    abstract = {Approximately 9.5billiontonnes of goods is transported over the world oceans annually with dry bulk representing the largest cargo group. This paper aims to analyse whether the transport and associated inputs of dry bulks into the sea create a risk for the marine environment. For this purpose, we analyse the international regulatory background concerning environmental protection (MARPOL), estimate quantities and identify inputs of such cargoes into the oceans (accidental and operational), and use available information for hazard assessment. Annually, more than 2.15milliontonnes of dry bulk cargoes are likely to enter the oceans, of which 100,000tonnes are potentially harmful to the marine environment according to the definition included in draft maritime regulation. The assessment of the threat to the marine environment is hampered by a lack of available information on chemical composition, bioavailability and toxicity. Perspectives for amendments of the unsatisfying pollution prevention regulations are discussed.}

    abstract = {Shipping is one of the major transportation approaches around the world. With the growing demands for global shipping service, vessel destination prediction has shown its significant role in improving the efficiency of decision making in industry and ensuring a safe and efficient maritime traffic environment. Currently, most vessel destination prediction methods focus on regional destination prediction, which has restrictions on destinations and regions. Thus, this paper proposes a general AIS (Automatic Identification System) data-driven model for vessel destination prediction. In this random forest-based model, the similarity between the vessel’s traveling and historical trajectories are measured and utilized to predict the destination. The destination of the historical trajectory, which shares the highest similarity with the traveling trajectory, is predicted as the vessel’s destination. The method is different from previous work which used maritime records as input to predict the destination. In our method, a historical trajectory database was generated from more than 141 million AIS records, which covers 534,824 traveling patterns between ports and more than 5.9 million historical trajectories. Comparative studies were carried out to validate the performance of the proposed model, where eleven state-of-the-art trajectories similarity measurement methods combined with two different decision strategies were implemented and compared. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model combined with the port frequency-based decision strategy achieves the best prediction accuracy on 35,937 testing trajectories.}

    ABSTRACT = {Understanding maritime traffic patterns is key to Maritime Situational Awareness applications, in particular, to classify and predict activities. Facilitated by the recent build-up of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers, ship movement information is becoming increasingly available, both in coastal areas and open waters. The resulting amount of information is increasingly overwhelming to human operators, requiring the aid of automatic processing to synthesize the behaviors of interest in a clear and effective way. Although AIS data are only legally required for larger vessels, their use is growing, and they can be effectively used to infer different levels of contextual information, from the characterization of ports and off-shore platforms to spatial and temporal distributions of routes. An unsupervised and incremental learning approach to the extraction of maritime movement patterns is presented here to convert from raw data to information supporting decisions. This is a basis for automatically detecting anomalies and projecting current trajectories and patterns into the future. The proposed methodology, called TREAD (Traffic Route Extraction and Anomaly Detection) was developed for different levels of intermittency (i.e., sensor coverage and performance), persistence (i.e., time lag between subsequent observations) and data sources (i.e., ground-based and space-based receivers).},
